# Simple Zerg Bot for Starcraft 2
Note: this is a scripted bot, i.e. does not use any automated learning, although I am planning on using evolutionary computation to attempt to train certain actions of the bot.

A lot of functions were either taken from [CommandCenter](https://github.com/davechurchill/CommandCenter) or were heavily inspired by it, big thanks to [David Churchill](https://github.com/davechurchill)
